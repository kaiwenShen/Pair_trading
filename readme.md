## Introduction
This is a project I completed during my course of Numerical analysis in Master of Mathematical Finance program in University of Toronto. 

The idea was to use monte-carlo simulation to simulate the spread between pepsi and coke, and formulate a simple pair trading strategy.

The emphasis was not so much on the trading strategy, but rather on the stochastic path simulation with embedded correlation and mean-reversion behaviour of the spread.

The major code is in the ko_pep.ipynb file. There is also a three slide ppt to demonstrate the code.
